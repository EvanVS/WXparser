# WeatherStationParser
This script takes serial data from Argent Data System's ADS-WS1 and Peet Bros ULTIMETER Series and generates a JSON, XML and Prometheus API hosted on a flask webserver.

Its currently in its early stages and is working but please plan on future updates. I will try to keep this README.md file updated.

Talked about in my blogpost: https://evan.kj7bre.com/blog/weather-station/
